  <h3><em>Description</em></h3>
  <p>
    Mongolian Ground Beef is a 20 minute stir fry bursting with 
    sweet and savory Asian flavors. It’s a perfect weeknight meal 
    to come back to again and again.<br><br>

    We love our Mongolian Beef, based off of the popular takeout 
    dish, but this time we’re simplifying it for you.<br><br>

    Give this easier, ground beef version a try in your kitchen tonight!
